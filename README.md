## Project Overview

This project uses DataRobot to build and evaluate a machine learning model on structured tabular data. I trained the model on the California Housing dataset to predict housing prices. The model's performance was assessed using metrics like RMSE and visualized with ROC curves and learning curves. Predictions were exported and compared against test data for validation.
